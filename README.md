  # PWA Text Editor
  

  ## Description
  This is a progressive web application that functions as a text editor and runs in the browser. My motivation for creating this application was to learn about web-pack and PWA's in gneneral.  Working on this project has taught me about webpack, service workers and how to optimize performance in applications.
